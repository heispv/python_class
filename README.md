* [01_python_basics](https://github.com/heispv/python_class/blob/master/01_python_basics.ipynb): In this session we talked about how can we install python and use it as a simple calculator, then we discussed about different types of variables and likes integers, floats, strings and boolians, talked about how to use indexing in order to slice our data and use them later. Also started to talk about Lists which is going to be completed in the next session.

* [02_python_basics](https://github.com/heispv/python_class/blob/master/02_python_basics.ipynb): In this session we talked about Lists and their methods like append(), insert(), index(), count() etc. Also talked about Tuples and Dictionaries and their methods. Note that Dictionaries part will be finished in the next session.

* [03_python_basics](https://github.com/heispv/python_class/blob/master/03_python_basics.ipynb): In this session we finished the Dictionaries topic. We talked about if ... else and also how to use and/or with. Also started to talk about Loops which is going to be completed in the next session.

* [04_python_basics](https://github.com/heispv/python_class/blob/master/04_python_basics.ipynb) : This session's main purpose was to learn how can we search in the internet to find the answer which is suitable for the problem that we may face. We also answered to the questions of some students. A question has mentioned in the end of the class for students to solve.

* [05_python_basics](https://github.com/heispv/python_class/blob/master/05_python_basics.ipynb) : In this session we talked about how can we use while to create a loop in our program, also we understood what is a function and how can we use it so that we can use it later in our program. Students should work on two exercises, a fucntion to distinguish between odd and even numbers, a function to write the first n numbers in Fibonacci series.
