## Table of Content

* [01_python_basics](https://github.com/heispv/python_class/blob/master/01_python_basics.ipynb): During this session, we talked about installing Python and using it as a calculator. Then we discussed variables like integers, floats, strings, and booleans, and how to use indexing to slice our data. The next session will focus on lists, which have already begun.

* [02_python_basics](https://github.com/heispv/python_class/blob/master/02_python_basics.ipynb): In this session we talked about Lists and their methods like append(), insert(), index(), count() etc. Also talked about Tuples and Dictionaries and their methods. Note that Dictionaries part will be finished in the next session.

* [03_python_basics](https://github.com/heispv/python_class/blob/master/03_python_basics.ipynb): In this session we finished the Dictionaries topic. We talked about if ... else and also how to use and/or with. Also started to talk about Loops which is going to be completed in the next session.

* [04_python_basics](https://github.com/heispv/python_class/blob/master/04_python_basics.ipynb) : This session's main purpose was to learn how can we search in the internet to find the answer which is suitable for the problem that we may face. We also answered to the questions of some students. A question has mentioned in the end of the class for students to solve.

* [05_python_basics](https://github.com/heispv/python_class/blob/master/05_python_basics.ipynb) : In this session we talked about how can we use while to create a loop in our program, also we understood what is a function and how can we use it so that we can use it later in our program. Students should work on two exercises, a fucntion to distinguish between odd and even numbers, a function to write the first n numbers in Fibonacci series.

* [06_python_basics](https://github.com/heispv/python_class/blob/master/06_python_basics.ipynb) : As a programmer sometimes you may find it a bit challenging when you want to implement your knowledge into a program. I find it useful to first understand the problem very well and change it into an algorithm to understand what you are going to do exactly and also you should't forget your best friend, Google. In this session we talked about how to solve last session's problems and also practical ways of searching in the internet.

* [07_python_basics](https://github.com/heispv/python_class/blob/master/07_python_basics.ipynb) : You don't need to write everything you need, it is why there are lots of libraries and packages available for python. In this session we talked about some packages and libraries in python and how to import them. Some searching techniques also exaplained during the class.

* [08_python_basics](https://github.com/heispv/python_class/blob/master/08_python_basics.ipynb) : In this session we talked about one the most popular libraries in python. Numpy is well-known python library which is used to work with arrays. Students should write a program to simulate rock, paper, scissors game.

* [09_python_basics](https://github.com/heispv/python_class/blob/master/09_python_basics.ipynb) : Rock, paper, scissors game explained. We also searched together in Matplotlib.pytplot documentation in order to find out how can we explore a library's documentation and apply them in our programming for the first time.

* [10_python_basics](https://github.com/heispv/python_class/blob/master/10_python_basics.ipynb) : In this session we continued to talk about Matplotlib library and at the end we had a brief introduction to pandas library. Students should explore kaggle and w3schools to complete some courses and read some documentations.

* [11_python_basics](https://github.com/heispv/python_class/blob/master/11_python_basics.ipynb) : In this session, we started to talk about OOP and its benefits. The class has provided some examples as well as a class assignment.

* [12_python_basics](https://github.com/heispv/python_class/blob/master/12_python_basics.ipynb) : In this session, we continued to talk about OOP programming. It was explained to the students how inheritance can be applied in a practical way as well as how to use it.

* [13_python_basics](https://github.com/heispv/python_class/blob/master/13_python_basics.ipynb) : Almost every computer has the Minesweeper game on it. How about writing the game ourselves? The best way to solve this problem is to use OOP programming along with other methods we learned before, so we started writing the game in this session.

* [14_python_basics](https://github.com/heispv/python_class/blob/master/13_python_basics.ipynb) : We continued to implement the Minesweeper game using Python.
